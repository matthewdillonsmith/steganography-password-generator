# Steganography Password Generator

Welcome to the **Steganography Password Generator**! This Python application allows users to generate highly secure passwords by embedding them into images using steganography techniques. Users can use any image of their choice to create password/key pairs, enhancing the security and uniqueness of their passwords.

## Features
- **Generate Secure Passwords**: Creates strong, random passwords combining letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Embed Passwords into Images**: Uses steganography to embed encrypted passwords into user-selected images.
- **Extract Passwords from Images**: Retrieves and decrypts passwords embedded within images.
- **Key Management**: Allows users to create new encryption keys and load existing ones for password encryption and decryption.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive GUI using Tkinter for easy interaction.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Enables quick copying of generated or extracted passwords to the clipboard.
